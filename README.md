## :rocket: About this project:

### This is a Junior challenge made by ScandiWeb:

#### You can find all the information here: https://www.notion.so/Entry-React-developer-TEST-39f601f8aa3f48ac88c4a8fefda304c1

#### Required: React (class components) and GraphQl. The endpoint was provided by Scandi.
#### All the requirements you can find in the link above.

### :smile: This was a real Challenge as this asks for use only class components, coming from Functional Components and almost 0 exprience with GraphQl "api" calls.

## :books: Technology used to make this app:

<img src="readmeimages/tech.png">

## Javascryt, React, GraphQl and Cypress for integration tests.

### Other things implemented: Good file modulation, Enums to avoid "magic numbers" (such as indexes or symbols), ApolloClient and most importantly: Integration Tests.
### Dashboard.jsx is the "handler" file.
### In utils folder you can find Enums, graphQl URI and Default values for avoiding magic numbers in the app structure.

## üß∞ Scripts:

### Run the GraphQl endpoint: in the link above you will fin the GitHub repository! All rights to ScandiWeb. It is not of my property.
### Run the app:

### 1st: npm install
### 2nd: npm run start (this will run the app in localhost:3000, the GraphQl endpoint runs at localhost:4000)
### 3rd (optional): If you want to continue the tests, you can run:
### > npm run cypress for headless tests
### > npm run cy for normal Cypress window.
#### (all tests are written in __tests__ folder)

## ‚ùì Difficulties writting the code:

### First, as I mentioned earlier the main difficulty was the Class Components.
### To handle the Product page and Mini-Cart logic, I implemented the Portal module that comes in react-app installation (first time using it). To implement it, a separated "root" needs to be created in the html file. You can go and see it if you like!
### For the description structure I chose to parse it with the "html-react-parser" library.

## In the end, this was a super nice challenge! Felt great an proud to finish this app and be able to share with ScandiWeb team.
